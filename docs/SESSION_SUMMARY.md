# Session Summary: Web UI Refactoring

## Date: Current Session

### What We Did Today

1. **Analyzed the old monolithic web UI** (5000+ lines in `src/web_ui/app.py`)
   - Extracted 14 major feature categories
   - Identified tight coupling with `AssetDocumentAgent` class

2. **Created new FastAPI-based architecture**
   - Built modular API with separate routers
   - Implemented dependency injection
   - Used HTMX + Bootstrap for dynamic UI

3. **Completed Phase 1 & 2 Features**:
   - ✅ Asset Management (CRUD)
   - ✅ Sender Mappings (CRUD)
   - ✅ Health Dashboard
   - ✅ System Information

4. **Fixed Critical Issues**:
   - Added missing `email-validator` dependency
   - Fixed `EpisodicMemory` initialization
   - Added missing CRUD methods to `SenderMappingService`
   - Fixed template field references

5. **Pushed to GitHub**:
   - Commit 1: Major refactor with new FastAPI structure
   - Commit 2: Automatic formatting improvements

### Current Status
- **Server Running**: http://localhost:8000
- **Working Features**: Assets, Senders, Health, Dashboard
- **Old Code**: Safely archived in `archive/old_asset_system/`

### Next Steps
Priority: Email Processing UI
- Extract logic from old `app.py`
- Create email processing endpoints
- Build processing history view
- Add human review queue

### Quick Commands
```bash
# Start server
python -m src.web_api.main

# View UI
open http://localhost:8000

# View API docs
open http://localhost:8000/api/docs
```

## Key Takeaways

- FastAPI + HTMX provides a clean, modern alternative to monolithic Flask apps
- Proper service architecture with dependency injection is worth the refactoring effort
- The project is now ready for continued development with Phase 3 features

### Deep Cleanup (Latest Update)

6. **Comprehensive Project Cleanup**:
   - Archived `/assets/` directory with all test documents
   - Archived `/data/` directory with runtime data (processed_emails.json, etc.)
   - Archived `/examples/` directory with outdated documentation
   - Archived `/knowledge/` directory except `asset_data.json`
   - Archived all old log files
   - Removed empty directories (`processed_attachments/`, `test_assets/`)
   - Created new minimal `/knowledge/` directory with only `asset_data.json` for testing
   - Kept memory utility scripts in root (still useful for development)

The project now has a clean structure with:
- Active code in `/src/`
- Current docs in `/docs/`
- All outdated content safely in `/archive/`
- Minimal `/knowledge/` for testing
- Clean root directory

## Next Session

Pick up with Phase 3 from `docs/REFACTORING_PROGRESS.md` - Email Processing features!
