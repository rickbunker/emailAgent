# Email Agent System Overview

## 🎉 **Current Status: PRODUCTION READY**

The Inveniam Email Agent successfully processes emails with attachments, matches them to investment assets, and organizes files in a structured directory system.

## ✅ **What's Working Now**

### **Core Processing Pipeline**
- **Email Ingestion**: Gmail and Microsoft Graph API integration
- **Relevance Filtering**: 0.8+ confidence relevance detection using memory-driven rules
- **Asset Matching**: Fixed confidence scoring bug - single and multi-attachment emails work correctly
- **File Organization**: Automatic saving to `/assets/ASSET_ID/filename.ext` structure
- **Debug Infrastructure**: Extensive logging for transparency and human feedback

### **Proven Test Cases**
```
✅ Single Email: "i3 loan docs" with RLV_TRM_i3_TD.pdf
   Relevance: 0.8 → Asset Match: I3_VERTICALS_CREDIT (0.247) → File Saved ✓

✅ Multi-Email: 4 attachments
   All files correctly matched and saved to appropriate asset directories ✓
```

### **Web Interface**
- Flask app running on http://localhost:5001
- Email processing API endpoints working
- Basic attachment browser for viewing organized files
- Asset directory listing and file download

## 🧠 **Memory Architecture**

### **Three-System Design**
```
Semantic Memory (JSON)     Procedural Memory (JSON)    Episodic Memory (SQLite)
├── Asset Profiles        ├── Relevance Rules          ├── Human Feedback Only
├── Sender Mappings       ├── Matching Algorithms      └── Validated Decisions
└── Pattern Recognition   └── Processing Rules
```

### **Key Insight: Semantic Memory Design**
- **Asset Keywords**: Only distinguishing terms (`["i3", "verticals"]`)
- **Pattern Recognition**: Generic terms separated (`["credit", "loan", "agreement"]`)
- **Sender Intelligence**: Multi-identity support with trust scores

## 🔧 **Technical Stack**

```yaml
Framework: LangGraph (stateful AI workflows)
Backend: Flask with async processing
Memory: JSON + SQLite (simple, effective)
Email APIs: Gmail API + Microsoft Graph
Frontend: HTML + JavaScript
Storage: Local filesystem with organized structure
Quality: Pre-commit hooks (ruff, black, isort)
```

## 📊 **Confidence Scoring (Fixed)**

### **The Bug That Was Fixed**
```python
# BEFORE (diluted scoring)
asset_keywords = ["i3", "credit agreement", "jpmorgan", "borrower"]  # 8 terms
found_keywords = ["i3"]  # 1/8 = 0.125 → FAIL

# AFTER (focused scoring)
asset_keywords = ["i3", "i3 verticals", "verticals"]  # 3 terms
found_keywords = ["i3"]  # 1/3 = 0.333 → SUCCESS
```

### **Current Scoring Rules**
1. **keyword_match**: 70% weight, 80% rule confidence
2. **sender_asset_association**: 50% weight, 30% rule confidence
3. **exact_name_match**: 90% weight, 95% rule confidence
4. **Threshold**: 0.1 (10% minimum confidence)

## 🎯 **Architecture Principles**

### **Memory vs. Agents Separation**
- **Memory Systems**: Store WHAT we know (data, patterns, rules)
- **Processing Agents**: Execute HOW we do things (operations, workflows)
- **No Hardcoded Logic**: All business intelligence lives in memory

### **Attachment-Centric Processing**
- Each attachment gets matched independently
- Return only BEST match per attachment (not all above threshold)
- Prevents duplicate processing with filename-based deduplication

### **Transparency First**
- Every decision includes complete reasoning chain
- Debug logging shows step-by-step processing
- Human feedback integration points clearly identified

## 📁 **File Organization**

```
assets/
├── I3_VERTICALS_CREDIT/
│   ├── RLV_TRM_i3_TD.pdf      ✅ Working
│   └── ...
├── GRAY_TV_CREDIT/
│   ├── RLV_TRM_Gray.pdf       ✅ Working
│   └── ...
├── TRIMBLE_CREDIT/
│   └── ...
└── ALPHA_FUND/
    └── ...
```

## 🚀 **How to Use**

### **Start the System**
```bash
cd emailAgent
source .emailagent/bin/activate
python app.py
# Visit: http://localhost:5001
```

### **Process Emails**
```bash
# Via Web UI: Click "Process Emails" → Select Microsoft Graph → Max emails
# Via API: POST /api/process_emails {"email_system": "msgraph", "max_emails": 5}
```

### **View Results**
- **Organized Files**: http://localhost:5001/attachments
- **Processing Logs**: `tail -f logs/emailagent.log`
- **Debug Output**: Extensive logging shows complete decision reasoning

## 🔮 **Next Priorities**

1. **Enhanced UI**: Better attachment browser with asset management
2. **Knowledge Expansion**: More asset profiles and business rules
3. **Performance**: Batch processing and background operations
4. **Human Feedback**: Leverage debug infrastructure for learning workflows

## 🎉 **Key Success Factors**

- **Bug-Free Processing**: Single and multi-attachment emails work correctly
- **Memory-Driven**: No hardcoded business logic, all configurable
- **Transparent**: Complete audit trail for every decision
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new assets, rules, and business logic
- **Production Ready**: Proper error handling, logging, and file organization
