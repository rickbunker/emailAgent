## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

- **`test-virus.txt`** contains the EICAR test virus signature - **harmless for testing only**
- All debug scripts require proper Microsoft Graph credentials setup
- Performance scripts may take significant time for large test sets
- Test harness is integrated with the Makefile for convenient usage
- All scripts should be run from the project root directory
- Source extraction script automatically excludes sensitive configuration files

## üîó **Integration with Development Workflow**

These scripts are integrated into the development workflow:

- **Makefile targets** use `test_harness.py` for quality assurance
- **CI/CD pipelines** can leverage these scripts for automated testing
- **Performance monitoring** can use the benchmarking scripts
- **Debugging workflows** are streamlined with the Graph debugging tools
- **Source distribution** is simplified with the extraction utility

## Memory System Initialization

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Memory Initialization vs. Application Startup

**Memory initialization is SEPARATE from normal application startup:**

- **Normal Application Startup**: Reads existing patterns from persistent memory (Qdrant)
- **Memory Initialization**: Only run when explicitly needed to reset or initially populate memory

### When to Initialize Memory

Memory initialization should ONLY be run in these specific scenarios:

1. **Initial System Deployment** - First-time setup on a new environment
2. **Testing Environment Reset** - Clearing test data to start fresh
3. **Knowledge Base Updates** - After significant changes to JSON pattern files
4. **Emergency Reset** - Recovering from corrupted memory state

### When NOT to Initialize Memory

**NEVER run initialization in production unless absolutely necessary because:**
- It will reset patterns to baseline versions
- All learned improvements from human feedback will be preserved in episodic memory
- But refined pattern effectiveness scores will be lost
- The system will need to re-learn optimizations

### Production Memory Persistence

In production, the memory system:
- **Persists across application restarts** (stored in Qdrant)
- **Continuously learns** from human feedback
- **Refines pattern effectiveness** over time
- **Grows in intelligence** without manual intervention

The JSON files serve as version-controlled baselines, but the living memory in Qdrant becomes increasingly valuable over time.

### Initialization Scripts

#### `initialize_memory.py`
Main script for setting up or resetting the memory system.

```bash
# First-time setup
python scripts/initialize_memory.py

# Reset to baseline patterns (preserves episodic learning)
python scripts/initialize_memory.py --reset
```

**When to use:**
- Initial system deployment
- After updating JSON pattern files
- To reset to baseline patterns while preserving learned feedback

#### Individual Pattern Loaders

These scripts load specific pattern types into memory:

- `load_spam_patterns.py` - Spam detection patterns
- `load_contact_patterns.py` - Contact extraction patterns
- `load_asset_types.py` - Asset types and document categories
- `load_all_patterns.py` - Loads all patterns (used by initialize_memory.py)

**Note:** These are typically called by `initialize_memory.py`, not directly.

## Development Workflow

### Adding New Patterns

1. Update the appropriate JSON file in `/knowledge`
2. Test the changes locally
3. Commit the JSON changes to version control
4. Run `python scripts/initialize_memory.py` to load into memory
5. Agents will now use the new patterns from memory

### Testing Pattern Changes

```bash
# Load patterns into a test environment
python scripts/load_spam_patterns.py  # or other specific loader

# Verify patterns loaded correctly
# Check the script output for confirmation
```

## Architecture Principles

1. **JSON files = Source Code**: Version controlled, human-readable pattern definitions
2. **Memory = Runtime**: Where agents read patterns during operation
3. **Initialization = Compilation**: Converting JSON to memory entries
4. **Learning = Runtime Updates**: Human feedback updates memory, not JSON files

This separation ensures:
- Clean version control of baseline patterns
- Runtime learning without modifying source files
- Easy reset to baseline when needed
- Clear audit trail of pattern changes
