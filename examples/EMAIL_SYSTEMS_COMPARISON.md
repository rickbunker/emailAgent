# Email Systems Comparison: Gmail vs Microsoft Graph

This document compares the spam management implementations for Gmail and Microsoft Graph (Office 365/Outlook).

## 🎯 Feature Comparison

| Feature | Gmail Implementation | Microsoft Graph Implementation |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Authentication** | Google OAuth 2.0 | Microsoft OAuth 2.0 + Azure AD |
| **Setup Complexity** | Simple (Google Cloud Console) | Moderate (Azure Portal) |
| **Email Storage** | Labels-based system | Folder-based system |
| **Spam Folder** | SPAM label (hidden) | Junk Email folder or custom Spam folder |
| **Contacts Integration** | Google People API (2,546 contacts) | Microsoft Graph Contacts API |
| **Batch Processing** | 50 emails per batch | 50 emails per batch |
| **Rate Limiting** | 1B quota units/day | 10K requests/10min/app/tenant |
| **Real-time Processing** | ✅ Full support | ✅ Full support |

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Gmail System**
```python
# Gmail uses labels for organization
await gmail.add_label(email_id, 'SPAM')      # Add SPAM label
await gmail.remove_label(email_id, 'INBOX')  # Remove from inbox

# Built-in SPAM label hides emails from normal views
spam_label = {'id': 'SPAM', 'name': 'Spam', 'type': 'system_spam'}
```

### **Microsoft Graph System**  
```python
# Microsoft Graph uses folder movement
url = f"{msgraph.GRAPH_ENDPOINT}/me/messages/{email_id}/move"
payload = {'destinationId': junk_folder['id']}
await msgraph.session.post(url, json=payload)

# Moves to Junk Email folder or custom Spam folder
junk_folder = {'id': 'folder_id', 'name': 'Junk Email', 'type': 'system_junk'}
```

## 📊 Performance Comparison

### **Gmail Advantages**
- **Faster Setup**: Google Cloud Console is more straightforward
- **Higher Rate Limits**: 1 billion quota units vs 10K requests/10min
- **Label Flexibility**: Can apply multiple labels simultaneously
- **Built-in Spam**: Native SPAM label with automatic hiding
- **Mature API**: Longer development history, more examples

### **Microsoft Graph Advantages**
- **Enterprise Integration**: Native Office 365/Exchange integration
- **Rich Metadata**: More detailed email properties and folder info
- **Advanced Permissions**: Granular access control via Azure AD
- **Folder Structure**: Familiar folder-based organization
- **Business Features**: Integration with Outlook rules and policies

## 🛡️ Security & Authentication

### **Gmail**
```python
# Google OAuth with specific Gmail scopes
SCOPES = [
    'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly',
    'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send', 
    'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify',
    'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/contacts.readonly'
]

# Simple credentials file
credentials = {
    'credentials_file': 'gmail_credentials.json',
    'token_file': 'gmail_token.json'
}
```

### **Microsoft Graph**
```python
# Microsoft Graph with Azure AD
SCOPES = [
    'https://graph.microsoft.com/Mail.ReadWrite',
    'https://graph.microsoft.com/Mail.Send',
    'https://graph.microsoft.com/User.Read',
    'https://graph.microsoft.com/Contacts.Read'
]

# Azure app registration required
credentials = {
    'client_id': 'azure_app_client_id',
    'tenant_id': 'tenant_or_common',
    'redirect_uri': 'http://localhost:8080'
}
```
