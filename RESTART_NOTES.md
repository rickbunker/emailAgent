# Email Agent - Restart Notes (2025-06-23 Evening)

## Status Summary
Major progress made on attachment-centric processing, but **critical single-attachment email still failing**.

### Fixes Applied Tonight

1. **Asset Matcher Fixed** - Returns only BEST match per attachment (not all above threshold)
2. **Attachment Processor** - Added SELECT DISTINCT logic to prevent duplicate processing
3. **Episodic Memory Pollution** - Fixed feedback integrator to only record human-validated feedback
4. **Semantic Memory Search** - Fixed backwards search logic
5. **Email Body Inclusion** - Asset matching now includes subject, filename, AND body text
6. **Memory Cleanup** - Cleared polluted episodic memory database

### Current Results
- **Multi-attachment emails**: Working correctly - 4 attachments → 4 matches
- **Single attachment "i3 loan docs"**: **STILL FAILING** despite:
  - Subject: "i3 loan docs"
  - Body: "attached find the loan documents for the i3 deal"
  - Filename: "RLV_TRM_i3_TD.pdf"
  - All contain clear "i3" indicators

### Evidence from Latest Test
```
Asset Matches: 4
- IDT_TELECOM_CREDIT (confidence: 0.7395)
- TRIMBLE_CREDIT (confidence: 0.7395)
- I3_VERTICALS_CREDIT (confidence: 0.6094999999999999)
- GRAY_TV_CREDIT (confidence: 0.273)
```

**The single "i3" email is finding I3_VERTICALS_CREDIT but with lower confidence (0.609) than the others.**

## Critical Issue to Debug Tomorrow

**WHY is the single "i3" email getting lower confidence than the multi-attachment emails?**

The single email has:
- MORE specific "i3" references than the multi-attachment emails
- Should be getting the HIGHEST confidence, not lower

### Debugging Steps for Tomorrow:

1. **Add detailed debug logging** to asset matcher confidence calculation
2. **Compare scoring** between single vs multi-attachment processing
3. **Check if sender association** is interfering (rick@bunker.us vs rbunker@invconsult.com)
4. **Verify search term extraction** from single vs multi emails
5. **Check if email body parsing** is different between the two cases

### Architecture Status
- ✅ Attachment-centric processing working
- ✅ Memory pollution cleaned up
- ✅ Duplicate prevention working
- ❌ **Single attachment confidence scoring broken**

### Flask App Status
- App running on port 5001
- All major fixes committed and pushed
- Clean episodic memory database

## Next Session Priority
**Fix the confidence scoring discrepancy that's causing the single "i3" email to get lower confidence than it deserves.**

This is the final critical bug preventing the system from working correctly.
