# Inveniam Email Agent - LangGraph Implementation

An intelligent email processing system that identifies and routes investment-related documents using LangGraph's graph-based architecture. **Built with clean separation between memory systems (knowledge) and processing agents (actions)** for maintainability and continuous learning.

## 🎯 Project Vision

Transform email attachment chaos into organized, actionable intelligence for investment asset management. The system learns from human feedback to continuously improve its decision-making accuracy.

## 🏗️ **Corrected Architecture** (Memory vs Agents)

**Critical Design Principle**: Clean separation between **what we know** (memory) and **what we do** (agents).

### 🧠 **Memory Systems** (Knowledge/Intelligence)
- **Semantic Memory**: Asset profiles, keywords, document patterns, **sender mappings & contact data**
- **Procedural Memory**: Rules and algorithms for HOW to do things (matching, processing, decisions)
- **Episodic Memory**: Historical decisions, human feedback, experiences for learning

**Note**: Contact data (sender mappings, trust scores, organization data) is now consolidated into semantic memory for cleaner architecture.

### ⚙️ **Processing Agents** (Actions/Operations)
- **RelevanceFilterNode**: Queries memory for relevance patterns → makes filtering decisions
- **AssetMatcherNode**: Uses procedural memory (algorithms) + semantic memory (asset data) → matches attachments
- **AttachmentProcessorNode**: Uses procedural memory (file rules) → performs file operations
- **FeedbackIntegratorNode**: Updates all memory systems based on human corrections

### 📊 **Processing Pipeline**
```
Email Ingestion → Relevance Filter → Asset Matcher → Attachment Processor → Feedback Loop
       ↑                 ↑                ↑                   ↑                  ↑
       └─────────────────┴────────────────┴───────────────────┴──────────────────┘
                                         |
                                    Memory Systems
                           (Semantic, Procedural, Episodic)
```

# Email processing thresholds
RELEVANCE_THRESHOLD = 0.7        # Minimum score for relevant emails
LOW_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.6   # Trigger human review
REQUIRES_REVIEW_THRESHOLD = 0.5  # Asset matching threshold

# Start from clean foundation
cd emailAgent
source .emailagent/bin/activate

# Test current simple memory system integration
python -c "
from src.memory import create_memory_systems
from src.agents.nodes.relevance_filter import RelevanceFilterNode
import asyncio

async def test():
    memory_systems = create_memory_systems()
    filter_node = RelevanceFilterNode(memory_systems)

    result = await filter_node.evaluate_relevance({
        'subject': 'Q3 Financial Report',
        'sender': 'advisor@example.com',
        'body': 'Quarterly investment statement attached',
        'attachments': [{'filename': 'report.pdf'}]

```

## 🎯 **Immediate Next Steps**

1. **Complete Agent Integration**: Connect AssetMatcher, AttachmentProcessor, and FeedbackIntegrator to memory systems
2. **Knowledge Enhancement**: Populate semantic memory with more realistic investment patterns and asset profiles
3. **LangGraph Update**: Update main email graph to use memory-driven agent nodes
4. **End-to-End Testing**: Verify complete pipeline with real email scenarios

## 🔍 **Key Architectural Decisions Made**

### ✅ **Corrected Misconceptions**
- **BEFORE**: "Asset matcher memory" - confused memory with processing
- **AFTER**: Clean separation - memory systems store knowledge, agents perform actions
- **BEFORE**: Hardcoded business logic in agent code
- **AFTER**: All business intelligence lives in memory systems

### ✅ **Design Principles Established**
- Memory systems answer "WHAT" (data, patterns, rules)
- Processing agents answer "HOW" (operations, workflows, actions)
- All decisions must be transparent with complete reasoning chains
- Human feedback continuously improves all memory systems
- Graceful degradation when memory systems aren't available

## 📊 **Success Metrics**

- **Architecture**: ✅ Clean memory/agent separation implemented
- **Pipeline**: ✅ End-to-end processing working with test data
- **Transparency**: ✅ Complete decision audit trails
- **Learning**: ✅ Human feedback integration framework
- **Maintainability**: ✅ No hardcoded business logic
- **Extensibility**: ✅ Memory-driven approach allows easy updates
