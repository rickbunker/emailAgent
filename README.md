# Inveniam Email Agent - LangGraph Implementation

An intelligent email processing system that identifies and routes investment-related documents using LangGraph's graph-based architecture. **Built with clean separation between memory systems (knowledge) and processing agents (actions)** for maintainability and continuous learning.

## 🎯 Project Vision

Transform email attachment chaos into organized, actionable intelligence for investment asset management. The system learns from human feedback to continuously improve its decision-making accuracy.

## 🏗️ **Corrected Architecture** (Memory vs Agents)

**Critical Design Principle**: Clean separation between **what we know** (memory) and **what we do** (agents).

### 🧠 **Memory Systems** (Knowledge/Intelligence)
- **Semantic Memory**: Asset profiles, keywords, sender-asset relationships, document patterns
- **Procedural Memory**: Rules and algorithms for HOW to do things (matching, processing, decisions)
- **Episodic Memory**: Historical decisions, human feedback, experiences for learning

### ⚙️ **Processing Agents** (Actions/Operations)
- **RelevanceFilterNode**: Queries memory for relevance patterns → makes filtering decisions
- **AssetMatcherNode**: Uses procedural memory (algorithms) + semantic memory (asset data) → matches attachments
- **AttachmentProcessorNode**: Uses procedural memory (file rules) → performs file operations
- **FeedbackIntegratorNode**: Updates all memory systems based on human corrections

### 📊 **Processing Pipeline**
```
Email Ingestion → Relevance Filter → Asset Matcher → Attachment Processor → Feedback Loop
       ↑                 ↑                ↑                   ↑                  ↑
       └─────────────────┴────────────────┴───────────────────┴──────────────────┘
                                         |
                                    Memory Systems
                           (Semantic, Procedural, Episodic)
```

## 🔄 **What Still Needs to Be Done**

### **Phase 2: Memory System Integration** 🚧
Currently all nodes use placeholder memory methods that log warnings:
- [ ] Connect `RelevanceFilterNode` to actual semantic/procedural memory
- [ ] Connect `AssetMatcherNode` to actual semantic/procedural memory
- [ ] Connect `AttachmentProcessorNode` to actual procedural memory
- [ ] Connect `FeedbackIntegratorNode` to actual memory storage
- [ ] Replace placeholder methods with real Qdrant queries

### **Phase 3: Knowledge Population** 📚
- [ ] Load investment patterns and keywords into semantic memory
- [ ] Define asset profiles and sender relationships in semantic memory
- [ ] Create processing rules and algorithms in procedural memory
- [ ] Establish baseline decision thresholds and weights
- [ ] Import existing business rules and patterns

### **Phase 4: LangGraph Integration** 🔗
- [ ] Update `src/agents/email_graph.py` to use new agent nodes
- [ ] Replace placeholder graph implementation with real nodes
- [ ] Add proper state management and checkpointing
- [ ] Implement conditional routing based on confidence scores

### **Phase 5: Real Email Integration** 📧
- [ ] Connect Gmail and Microsoft Graph APIs for live email processing
- [ ] Add attachment downloading and content extraction
- [ ] Implement email filtering and batch processing
- [ ] Add scheduling and monitoring capabilities

### **Phase 6: Web UI and Human Review** 🖥️
- [ ] Build FastAPI web interface for human feedback
- [ ] Create review queues for low-confidence decisions
- [ ] Add asset management and configuration UI
- [ ] Implement feedback forms and correction workflows

## 🛠️ **Technical Stack**

- **Framework**: LangGraph for stateful agent workflows ✅

LOW_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.6   # Trigger human review
REQUIRES_REVIEW_THRESHOLD = 0.5  # Asset matching threshold

# File processing
ASSETS_BASE_PATH = "./assets"     # Base directory for organized files
MAX_ATTACHMENT_SIZE_MB = 50       # File size limit
ALLOWED_FILE_EXTENSIONS = ["pdf", "xlsx", "docx", "jpg", "png"]

# Memory system limits

## 🚀 **Getting Started (Current)**

```bash
# Start from clean foundation
cd emailAgent
source .emailagent/bin/activate

# Test current memory-driven architecture
python test_memory_driven_architecture.py

4. **Testing**: Verify memory-driven decisions with real data

## 🔍 **Key Architectural Decisions Made**

### ✅ **Corrected Misconceptions**
- **BEFORE**: "Asset matcher memory" - confused memory with processing
- **AFTER**: Clean separation - memory systems store knowledge, agents perform actions
- **BEFORE**: Hardcoded business logic in agent code
- **AFTER**: All business intelligence lives in memory systems

### ✅ **Design Principles Established**
- Memory systems answer "WHAT" (data, patterns, rules)
- Processing agents answer "HOW" (operations, workflows, actions)
- All decisions must be transparent with complete reasoning chains
- Human feedback continuously improves all memory systems
- Graceful degradation when memory systems aren't available

## 📊 **Success Metrics**

- **Architecture**: ✅ Clean memory/agent separation implemented
- **Pipeline**: ✅ End-to-end processing working with test data
- **Transparency**: ✅ Complete decision audit trails
- **Learning**: ✅ Human feedback integration framework
- **Maintainability**: ✅ No hardcoded business logic
- **Extensibility**: ✅ Memory-driven approach allows easy updates
