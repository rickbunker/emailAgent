# Inveniam Email Agent - LangGraph Implementation

An intelligent email processing system that identifies and routes investment-related documents using LangGraph's graph-based architecture. **Built with clean separation between memory systems (knowledge) and processing agents (actions)** for maintainability and continuous learning.

## 🎯 Project Vision

Transform email attachment chaos into organized, actionable intelligence for investment asset management. The system learns from human feedback to continuously improve its decision-making accuracy.

## 🎉 **Current Status: PRODUCTION READY!**

**Major confidence scoring bug RESOLVED** - Single and multi-attachment emails now correctly process with proper asset matching and file saving.

## 📊 **Detailed Email Processing Flow**

### **Phase 1: Email Ingestion**
```
Email Source (Gmail/Microsoft Graph)
    ↓
Email Interface Layer (src/email_interface/)
    ↓
EmailProcessingGraph Coordinator
    ↓
EmailState Structure:
{
  "subject": "i3 loan docs",
  "sender": "rick@bunker.us",
  "body": "attached find the loan documents for the i3 deal",
  "attachments": [
    {
      "filename": "RLV_TRM_i3_TD.pdf",
      "content": <bytes>,
      "content_type": "application/pdf",
      "size": 2457600
    }
  ]
}
```

### **Phase 2: Relevance Evaluation** (`RelevanceFilterNode`)
```
Input: EmailState
    ↓
1. Query Procedural Memory for relevance rules:
   - financial_keywords: ["investment", "credit", "loan", "agreement"]
   - sender_patterns: trusted domains and known contacts
   - attachment_types: PDF, Excel, Word documents
    ↓
2. Query Semantic Memory for context:
   - known_senders: sender trust scores and associations
   - asset_related_terms: investment-specific vocabulary
    ↓
3. Analysis Process:
   - Combine subject + body text
   - Extract meaningful terms: ["i3", "loan", "docs", "documents", "deal"]
   - Check sender mapping: rick@bunker.us → FOUND in semantic memory
   - Match against relevance patterns
    ↓
4. Scoring:
   - Content relevance: 0.8 (strong financial/investment indicators)
   - Sender trust: 0.95 (known trusted sender)
   - Attachment relevance: 1.0 (PDF document type)
   - Final relevance: 0.8
    ↓
Output: {relevance: "relevant", confidence: 0.8, reasoning: [...]}
```

### **Phase 3: Asset Matching** (`AssetMatcherNode`)
```
Input: EmailState + Relevance Result
    ↓
1. Extract Search Terms:
   - From subject: ["i3", "loan", "docs"]
   - From body: ["attached", "find", "loan", "documents", "i3", "deal"]
   - From filename: ["rlv", "trm", "i3", "td"]
   - Combined unique terms: ["i3", "loan", "docs", "documents", "deal", "rlv", "trm", "td"]
    ↓
2. Query Asset Profiles from Semantic Memory:
   Priority terms (asset-specific): ["i3", "trm", "td"]
   General terms (limited): ["loan", "docs", "documents"]
    ↓
3. Asset Profile Matching:
   Found assets with relevance scores:
   - I3_VERTICALS_CREDIT: score=1.000 (perfect match on "i3")
   - GRAY_TV_CREDIT: score=0.200 (partial match on "trm")
   - TRIMBLE_CREDIT: score=0.150 (partial match on "trm")
    ↓
4. Detailed Scoring per Asset (I3_VERTICALS_CREDIT example):

   4a. Apply exact_name_match rule:
       Asset name: "i3 verticals credit agreement"
       Combined text: "rlv trm i3 td.pdf i3 loan docs attached find..."
       Word overlap: ["i3"] = 1/4 asset words
       Result: ✗ Insufficient overlap (needs 2+)
       Score: 0.0

   4b. Apply keyword_match rule:
       Asset keywords: ["i3", "i3 verticals", "verticals"]
       Found in text: ["i3"] = 1/3 keywords
       Match ratio: 1/3 = 0.33
       Base score: 0.33 × 0.8 (rule confidence) = 0.264
       Score: 0.264

   4c. Apply sender_asset_association rule:
       Sender: rick@bunker.us
       Query semantic memory for sender mapping...
       Found: rick@bunker.us → asset_ids: ["I3_VERTICALS_CREDIT", "ALPHA_FUND"]
       Match: ✓ Sender associated with this asset
       Score: 0.3 (rule confidence) × 0.5 (rule weight) = 0.15

   4d. Final Asset Score:
       keyword_match: 0.264 × 0.7 (weight) = 0.185
       sender_association: 0.15 × 0.5 (weight) = 0.075
       Total: 0.185 + 0.075 = 0.260
       Capped at 1.0: 0.260
    ↓
5. Threshold Check:
   I3_VERTICALS_CREDIT: 0.260 > 0.1 (threshold) ✓
   GRAY_TV_CREDIT: 0.070 < 0.1 (threshold) ✗
    ↓
6. Best Match Selection (Attachment-Centric):
   Per attachment, return only the HIGHEST scoring match above threshold
   RLV_TRM_i3_TD.pdf → I3_VERTICALS_CREDIT (confidence: 0.260)
    ↓
Output: [
  {
    "attachment_filename": "RLV_TRM_i3_TD.pdf",
    "asset_id": "I3_VERTICALS_CREDIT",
    "confidence": 0.260,
    "reasoning": {detailed_scoring_breakdown}
  }
]
```

### **Phase 4: Attachment Processing** (`AttachmentProcessorNode`)
```
Input: Asset Matches + EmailState
    ↓
1. Deduplication Check:
   Group by filename → SELECT DISTINCT to prevent duplicate processing
    ↓
2. Per-Match Processing:
   For each unique attachment match:

   2a. Generate Target Path:
       Base: /Users/richardbunker/python/emailAgent/assets/
       Asset directory: I3_VERTICALS_CREDIT/
       Filename: RLV_TRM_i3_TD.pdf (preserve original)
       Full path: /assets/I3_VERTICALS_CREDIT/RLV_TRM_i3_TD.pdf

   2b. Security Validation:
       File size: 2,457,600 bytes < 52,428,800 (50MB limit) ✓
       Extension: .pdf in allowed extensions ✓
       Content type: application/pdf ✓

   2c. Directory Creation:
       Create /assets/I3_VERTICALS_CREDIT/ if not exists

   2d. File Save Operation:
       Write attachment content to target path
       Set file permissions: 644

   2e. Verification:
       Check file exists and size matches
       Record successful save in logs
    ↓
Output: {
  processed_count: 1,
  failed_count: 0,
  saved_files: ["/assets/I3_VERTICALS_CREDIT/RLV_TRM_i3_TD.pdf"]
}
```

### **Phase 5: Feedback Integration** (`FeedbackIntegratorNode`)
```
Input: Complete Processing Results
    ↓
1. Decision Trace Capture:
   - Email metadata and content
   - Relevance decision with full reasoning
   - Asset matching results with confidence scores
   - File processing outcomes
   - Any errors or edge cases
    ↓
2. Confidence Assessment:
   Relevance: 0.8 (high confidence)
   Asset matching: 0.260 (medium confidence - flag for potential review)
   Processing: 1.0 (successful file save)
    ↓
3. Action Determination:
   0.260 < 0.6 (low_confidence_threshold)
   → Flag for human review (learning opportunity)
    ↓
4. Memory System Updates (when human feedback received):
   - Semantic Memory: Update asset keywords, sender mappings
   - Procedural Memory: Adjust scoring rules and thresholds
   - Episodic Memory: Record validated human decisions
    ↓
Output: {
  feedback_required: "human_review_required",
  reasoning: "Medium confidence asset match - learning opportunity"
}
```

## 🧠 **Semantic Memory Architecture & Specifics**

### **Core Structure** (`data/memory/semantic_memory.json`)
```json
{
  "asset_profiles": {
    "I3_VERTICALS_CREDIT": {
      "name": "I3 Verticals Credit Agreement",
      "keywords": ["i3", "i3 verticals", "verticals"],
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "description": "Credit facility for I3 Verticals infrastructure investment",
      "asset_type": "credit_agreement",
      "sector": "telecommunications_infrastructure"
    }
  },

  "sender_mappings": {
    "rick@bunker.us": {
      "name": "Rick Bunker",
      "asset_ids": ["I3_VERTICALS_CREDIT", "ALPHA_FUND"],
      "trust_score": 0.95,
      "organization": "Inveniam Capital Partners",
      "relationship_type": "internal_analyst"
    },
    "rbunker@invconsult.com": {
      "name": "Rick Bunker (Consulting)",
      "asset_ids": ["I3_VERTICALS_CREDIT", "GRAY_TV_CREDIT", "TRIMBLE_CREDIT"],
      "trust_score": 0.90,
      "organization": "Investment Consulting LLC",
      "relationship_type": "external_consultant"
    }
  },

  "patterns": {
    "financial_document_indicators": [
      "credit agreement", "loan documents", "term sheet",
      "investor presentation", "financial statement"
    ],
    "urgency_indicators": [
      "urgent", "asap", "time sensitive", "deadline"
    ],
    "confidentiality_markers": [
      "confidential", "proprietary", "internal only", "nda required"
    ]
  }
}
```

### **Key Design Principles**

1. **Asset-Specific vs. Generic Terms**:
   - **Asset Keywords**: Only terms that distinguish between assets (`["i3", "verticals"]`)
   - **Pattern Recognition**: Generic financial terms stored separately (`["credit", "loan", "agreement"]`)
   - **Relevance vs. Matching**: Different vocabularies for different purposes

2. **Sender Intelligence**:
   - **Multi-Identity Support**: Same person with different email addresses
   - **Trust Scoring**: Confidence levels for different senders
   - **Asset Associations**: Which assets each sender typically handles
   - **Organizational Context**: Internal vs. external relationships

3. **Confidence Calibration**:
   - **Asset Confidence**: How certain we are about asset profile accuracy
   - **Sender Trust**: How much we trust documents from this sender
   - **Pattern Reliability**: How well patterns predict relevance

### **Search and Matching Logic**

1. **Priority-Based Search**:
   ```python
   # Extract terms from email content
   search_terms = ["i3", "loan", "documents", "trm", "td"]

   # Identify asset-specific terms (high priority)
   priority_terms = ["i3", "trm", "td"]  # Found in asset keywords
   general_terms = ["loan", "documents"]  # Generic financial terms

   # Search semantic memory
   for term in priority_terms:
       results = search_asset_profiles(term, limit=50)  # No limit for specific terms

   for term in general_terms[:5]:  # Limit generic terms to reduce noise
       results = search_asset_profiles(term, limit=10)
   ```

2. **Confidence Scoring Math**:
   ```python
   # Keyword matching example for I3_VERTICALS_CREDIT
   asset_keywords = ["i3", "i3 verticals", "verticals"]  # 3 terms
   found_keywords = ["i3"]  # 1 match
   match_ratio = 1/3 = 0.333
   base_score = 0.333 × 0.8 (rule_confidence) = 0.267

   # Sender association bonus
   sender_bonus = 0.3 × 0.5 = 0.15  # If sender is associated

   # Final score
   final_score = 0.267 + 0.15 = 0.417
   ```

3. **Memory Query Performance**:
   - **Fuzzy Text Matching**: Uses similarity scoring for partial matches
   - **Caching**: Recently queried asset profiles cached in memory
   - **Indexing**: Priority terms vs. general terms for efficient search

## 🏗️ **Corrected Architecture** (Memory vs Agents)

**Critical Design Principle**: Clean separation between **what we know** (memory) and **what we do** (agents).

### 🧠 **Memory Systems** (Knowledge/Intelligence)
- **Semantic Memory**: Asset profiles, keywords, **sender mappings & contact data**
- **Procedural Memory**: Rules and algorithms for HOW to do things (matching, processing, decisions)
- **Episodic Memory**: Historical decisions, human feedback, experiences for learning

**Note**: Contact data (sender mappings, trust scores, organization data) is consolidated into semantic memory for cleaner architecture.

### ⚙️ **Processing Agents** (Actions/Operations)
- **RelevanceFilterNode**: Queries memory for relevance patterns → makes filtering decisions
- **AssetMatcherNode**: Uses procedural memory (algorithms) + semantic memory (asset data) → matches attachments
- **AttachmentProcessorNode**: Uses procedural memory (file rules) → performs file operations
- **FeedbackIntegratorNode**: Updates all memory systems based on human corrections

### 📊 **Processing Pipeline**
```
Email Ingestion → Relevance Filter → Asset Matcher → Attachment Processor → Feedback Loop
       ↑                 ↑                ↑                   ↑                  ↑
       └─────────────────┴────────────────┴───────────────────┴──────────────────┘
                                         |
                                    Memory Systems
                           (Semantic, Procedural, Episodic)
```
